# Frontend Mentor challenge: Product preview card component

This is my implementation of the "Product preview card component" challenge

# How to install

The component was built using Vite.

You can see it in action in your local dev environment.
Just:

- Clone this repo
- run `npm install` in the root directory
- run `npm run dev`

And you're good to go!

# Suggestions and Pull Requests

Please, feel free to comment on anything regarding this implementation. Some of the decisions were:

- Start from a design system, using CSS custom properties.
- Create utility classes for some common layout and styling accross sites.
- Responsive first.
- Use of CSS Grid, and Flexbox.

Thanks for your feedback
